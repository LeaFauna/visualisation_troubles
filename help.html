                <b>IRA (prov): Irish Republican Army</b>
                <br><i>synonyms: Provisional Irish Republican Army (PIRA), Provos, Óglaigh Na hÉireann, Direct Action Against Drugs (DAAD)</i>
                <br>The Irish Republican Army (IRA) was the main Republican paramilitary group which was involved in the Northern Ireland conflict. The central aim of the IRA was to end British control of Northern Ireland and to achieve the reunification of the island of Ireland. The 'Irish Republican Army' dates from the meeting of the first Dáil on 21 January 1919 and was the name that was adopted by the Irish Volunteers who had taken part in the Easter Rising in Dublin in 1916. Following independence in the south of Ireland the IRA re-emerged at various times to conduct campaigns to try to end British rule in Northern Ireland. [...]
                <br>The <b>Provisional IRA</b> was established when the IRA split in December 1969 between the 'Officials' and the 'Provisionals'. Both groupings had a military wing, the 'Official' and the 'Provisional' IRA, and both had a political wing, 'Official' and 'Provisional' Sinn Féin (SF). The 'Official' IRA declared a ceasefire in the summer of 1972 and from then on the term IRA was used for the organisation that had developed from the 'Provisional' IRA. From a splinter group of a small and badly equipped paramilitary organisation, the 'Provisional' IRA developed into a comparatively large, well-financed, well-equipped guerrilla organisation which was involved in, what it called, an 'armed campaign' for almost three decades. This campaign involved violent attacks on security, political, economic and social targets in the region.

                <br><i>synonyms: Óglaigh na hÉireann; 'Dissident Republicans; 'dissident' Irish Republican Army; Irish Republican Army (IRA)</i>
                <br>This Republican Paramilitary group was formed in November 1997 from dissident members of the Irish Republican Army (IRA). These former members of the IRA were opposed to the 'peace process' and the political leadership of Sinn Féin.

                <b>OIRA (off.):</b> Official Irish Republican Army
                <br><i>synonyms: 'Officials'; 'Stickies'</i>
                <br>The Official Irish Republican Army (OIRA) was the term given to the remnants of the IRA following the split in 1970 when many members left to form the <b>Provisional Irish Republican Army (PIRA)</b>.

                <b>INLA: Irish National Liberation Army</b>
                <br><i>People's Liberation Army (PLA); People's Republican Army (PRA); Catholic Reaction Force (CRF)</i>
                <br>A Republican paramilitary group which was established in 1975. [...] At the time it was formed the INLA was considered to be the military wing of the Irish Republican Socialist Party (IRSP). The aim of the INLA, and the IRSP, is the re-unification of Ireland and the creation of a revolutionary socialist republic. [...]
                <br>The INLA has always been a much smaller, and less active paramilitary group than the <b>IRA</b>

                <br><i>synonyms: believed to have included - Catholic Reaction Force</i>
                <br>The IPLO began as breakaway faction from the <b>INLA</b>. The IPLO itself was then involved in a major feud in 1992 between an 'Army Council' group and another group called the 'Belfast Brigade'.

                <b>UVF: 'Ulster Volunteer Force</b>
                <br><i>synonyms: Protestant Action Force; Protestant Action Group</i>
                <br>The UVF is a Loyalist paramilitary group that was formed in 1966. The group adopted the name of the previous UVF which was formed in 1912 to oppose, by armed force, the arrangements for Home Rule in Ireland. [...] The aim of the present UVF is to ensure that Northern Ireland's constitutional position within the United Kingdom is secure.

                <b>UDA: 'Ulster Defence Association'</b>
                <br><i>synonyms: Ulster Freedom Fighters (UFF)</i>
                <br>The UDA was the largest Loyalist paramilitary group in Northern Ireland. It was formed in September 1971 from a number of Loyalist vigilante groups many of which were called 'defence associations' [...]. Members of the UDA have, since 1973, used the cover name of Ulster Freedom Fighters (UFF) to claim the responsibility for the killing of Catholics. Despite the well known link between the two groups the UDA was only proscribed (declared illegal) on 10 August 1992.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>LVF: Loyalist Volunteer Force</b>
                <br>The LVF is believed to have formed in 1996 from disaffected 'maverick' members of the mid-Ulster brigade of the <b>UVF</b>. The LVF was opposed to the ceasefire [...] in October 1994. [...] The LVF was proscribed by the British government in June 1997. Then a few months later its leader at that time, Billy Wright, was shot and killed by the <b>INLA</b> inside the Maze Prison on 27 December 1997. In the following weeks 10 Catholic civilians were shot dead by the LVF and the <b>UFF</b> in retaliation for Wright's killing. Although opposed to Good Friday Agreement (April 1998) the organisation decided to call a ceasefire in May 1998 but made clear its continuing opposition to the ongoing peace process. Since then the LVF has been suspected of continuing involvement in terrorist attacks and of having close links with a number of fringe loyalist paramilitaries who have engaged in a series of incidents.

            <p>
                <b>RHC: Red Hand Commando</b>
                <br>A small Loyalist paramilitary group which was, at times, closely associated with the <b>UVF</b>. The RHC was formed in 1972 and had its most support in east Belfast, the Sandy Row area, and parts of County Down. The group was declared illegal in 1973.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>RHD: Red Hand Defenders</b>
                <br>The name 'Red Hand Defenders', a Loyalist paramilitary grouping, was first used 1998. Initially the group was believed to be made up of dissident members of other Loyalist paramilitary goups who were opposed to the Good Friday Agreement. It was thought that the RHD had drawn its members from the Loyalist Volunteer Force (LVF), and also elements of the Ulster Defence Association (UDA) (and the UDA's covername the Ulster Freedom Fighters; UFF).

            <p>
                <b>BA: British Army</b>
                <br>The United Kingdom's (UK) standing army. The British Army has had a presence in the region prior to and following the partioning of Ireland and the establishment of a regional assembly in Northern Ireland. However, the army was only deployed on the streets of the region on 14 August 1969. This marked the beginning of 'Operation Banner'. For much of the conflict the British Army played the leading security role in the region. However, following the policy of 'Ulsterisation' the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) was given the lead role and the British Army played a supporting role.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>RUC: Royal Ulster Constabulary</b>
                <br><i>synonyms: Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI)</i>
                <br>The Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) was the name of the Northern Ireland police force from 1 June 1922 to 4 November 2001. During most of that period the RUC was almost entirely made up of officers drawn from the Protestant community - during the 1990s approximately 93 per cent of officers were Protestant. The force has come under a lot of criticism from the Nationalist community since its inception but particularly since the beginning of the current conflict. Following a period from 1969 to 1975 when the British Army had primacy in security matters, the RUC gradually took over the main responsibility for security. However, within the RUC itself Special Branch, the name of the RUC intelligence department, had primacy.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>UDR: Ulster Defense Regiment</b>
                <br>The UDR was a locally recruited regiment of the British Army and became operational on 1 April 1970. The UDR was merged with the Royal Irish Rangers in July 1992. The UDR was founded following recommendations in the Hunt Report which recommended the replacing of the Ulster Special Constabulary (USC; or 'B-Specials') with a regiment attached to the British Army. However, many of the members of the new regiment were former 'B-Specials' and while the UDR did initially attract Catholic membership of 18 per cent this figure soon fell. At the time of its merger the UDR had an almost exclusively Protestant membership with only 3 per cent Catholics. During its existence there were many allegations of links with Loyalist paramilitary groups and a number of UDR soldiers were convicted of the murder of Catholics and other crimes. Following the Stevens inquiry into collusion between the security forces and Loyalist paramilitary groups, 10 members of the UDR were charged with having information likely to be of use to terrorists.

              <b>OO: Orange Order</b>
              <br><i>synonyms: Loyal Orange Institution</i>
              <br>The largest of the three main Loyal Orders. The Orange Order was founded on 21 September 1795 and currently has between 80,000 to 100,000 members. The order has strong links with the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP). There are several thousand parades and marches each year associated with the Orange Order and the bands which play in the parades. Although there are parades all year round the climax occurs on 12 July each year when Orangemen celebrate the victory of King William III (William of Orange) over the Catholic King James II at the Battle of the Boyne in 1690. Most of the parades pass off peacefully but there are a number of contentious parades through Catholic areas and there has been considerable violence associated with them over the past few years.

            <p>
                <b>Nationalist:</b>
                <br> In Northern Ireland the term is used to describe those who hold a long-term wish for the reunification of Ireland. The majority of those people who are from the Catholic community are Nationalist. It should be noted that not all Nationalists support Republican groups.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Loyalist:</b>
                <br>Strictly the term Loyalist refers to one who is loyal to the British Crown. The term in Northern Ireland context is used by many commentators to imply that the person gives tacit or actual support the use of force by paramilitary groups to 'defend the union' with Britain.

              <br><u>Agency:</u> groups responsible for fatal incidents</h3>

            </p>
            <h3><u>Rationale:</u> inferred purpose underlying fatal act</h3>
            <p>
              <b>Security Force Target:</b> campaign mounted by Republican paramilitaries against members of the various arms of the Security Forces. The purpose of this activity appears to have been to inflict as many casualties as possible in order to exert political pressure on the British government by generating an impression of a government unable to impose its authority on the disputed territory.
              <br><b>Sectarian:</b> attacks on cultural centres (pubs, churches, etc.) where it could be presumed that patrons belonged to a particular religious group
              <br><b>Punitive:</b> coercive actions taken by paramilitary groups against specific individuals and groups other than members of the Security Forces. The purpose of these measures seems to have been to enforce internal discipline, intimidate state functionaries, punish informers and petty criminals and exact retribution from rival and hostile paramilitary groups for offensive actions. This category also includes actions taken by members of the Security Forces acting without sanction or authority
              <br>- <u>Internal Security:</u> action against own members or non members, who they suspected of being informers to security authorities
              <br>- <u>Enforcement:</u> individuals who were allegedly engaged in criminal and anti-social behaviour
              <br>- <u>Intimidation:</u> action against civilian targets who were judged to constitute a threat or an obstacle
              <br>- <u>Reprisal:</u> intimidation acts against prison staff
              <br>- <u>Factionalism:</u> action against other groups that to an outside observer seemed to have a common goal
              <br>- <u>Retaliatory:</u> action against individuals because of their involvement in paramilitary organisations or political groupings
              <br><b>Counter Insurgency:</b> actions taken by the Security Forces to counter subversive or inferred subversive activity. [...] [It] covers actions taken in response to what subsequently were revealed to be non political crimes, such as robberies and car theft, which had no political dimension
              <br><b>Economic Sabotage:</b> indicates the bombing campaign engaged in by Republican forces which was directed against industrial and commercial centres
              <br><b>Public Order:</b> actions taken by members of the Security Forces in response to non political criminal behaviour, the suppressing of riots and street disturbances and the maintenance of civic order
              <br><b>Adventitious:</b> cases that can't be grouped under any other label because of the chain of causality (e.g. deaths arising from road accidents occasioned by spontaneous rioting) 
              <br><b>General Subversion:</b> paramilitary activity that can't be grouped under any of those labels (e.g. bank raids or premature explosions)
            </p>
            <h3><u>Causality:</u> degree of inferred purposiveness of fatal event</h3>
            <p>
              <b>Volitional:</b> victim's death was clearly envisaged and deliberately procured 
              <br><b>Contingent:</b> deaths were insufficient warning was given of a bombing operation
              <br><b>Fortuitous:</b> self-induced deaths arising from premature explosions or accidental discharge of weapons
            </p>
            <h3><u>Context:</u> distinguishes between incidents such as gun fire, explosions, beatings</h3>
