An intimate, yet public, monument to those killed, The Ulster or Irish Linen Memorial is created on white, linen squares or handkerchiefs, with the names initially printed (2001), then overstitched with embroidery (2004-2009), and more recently work has started (2010) to stitch the first names with hair. The names of the dead are based on the list published in the book ?Lost Lives?. The physical layout of the linen squares changes with each exhibition venue.  The piece has been shown in the USA, Australia, Northern Ireland, and Canada. The memorial was originally funded by a visual art grant from the Canada Council for the Arts, in February 2001; additional funding since that year is listed on the Web site devoted to the piece:
http://www.linenmemorialcommunity.org/
The Linen Memorial is displayed in association with audio recordings of the names of the dead being read. A soundscape of a complete 'compressed and randomised' Names Reading during which all the names are read on 2 or 4 channels (speakers) within 40 minutes in total.
